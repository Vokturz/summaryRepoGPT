This repository 
contains a Python code that generates a histogram of 10,000 random normal distributed values using matplotlib library. The histogram has 20 equally spaced bins and imports numpy library to generate the random values and matplotlib library to create the histogram. The location of the files read and written is not applicable in this case as the code does not write any files.
